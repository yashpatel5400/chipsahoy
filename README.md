A Chip-8 emulator in C++! Mostly for educational purposes. The ROMs included are fully
thanks to: http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html. All the 
development was also as a result of following the advice/guide of:
http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/. Check
out his great guide if you want to also develop an emulator!

## Usage
To use the emulator, simply clone the repo, make it using "make chip", and
then run the chip executable with "chip <ROM name>". Note that the ROM name has to
include the directory name.
